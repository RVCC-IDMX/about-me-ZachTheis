# About Me: Zach Theis

This site is a combination between an online business card, a test for http and css techniques, and a showcase of those skills. It was created during my final semester at Raritan Valley Community College for Web Page Development 1. The specifics of each section will be enumerated below; more information on updates and online deployment can be found here:

## Header

The Header consists of a logo, created through [Figma](https://www.figma.com), a navigation bar, and a small amount of text.

### Nav Bar

The navigation bar uses anchor tags to link to section ids throughout the page. The current design - with the exception of the font selection - was created by Prof Cynthia Teeters as part of a lecture. It will likely be redesigned before this project's completion.

### Logo

The Logo for this page is a simple monogram, created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Unlike the majority of the page, the font for this was Oleo Script, chosen because it's bold lines are legible in miniature while still retaining some degree of the script style shared by the rest of the text on the page. The colors selected were #be03e8 and #0357e8, chosen with [Session's College color calculator](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/) for their complimentary nature with the background color of the body.

## Body

The main body of the website consists of a hero image, a bio, a phot gallery, an embedded video, a blog, and a contact form. These subsections will be discussed below, but because the color and font choices are common to all of them, I will address them here.

Five colors were chosen for this site: dark purple (#4d178f), light(er) purple (#8339db), dark green (#0b8f31), light green (#23db57), and tan (#dabb90). All were run past a filter for contrast and accessibility and, while the two purple shades and two green shades would be too close to use as background and text pairs, the overall color scheme of the website passed all tests. I selected dark purple as the background in order to provide the best contrast for a font color; I decided light green would have the best contrast with the dark purple background. Tan is used as the background color for elements that I wanted to highligh in their own box such as the photos in the gallery. Dark green is used as a thick border element on boxes to provide distinction against the dark purple background. The light purple is used very sparingly, only to provide small contrasting borders or textured effects.

The two fonts used on this site are Grenze and Grenze Gotish. Grenze makes up the bulk of the text; it is a serif font and so looks somewhat decorative, but it lacks the embellishments that would make smaller text difficult to read. Grenze Gotish, on the other hand, is a cursive font with plenty of decoration, perfect for the larger headers.
